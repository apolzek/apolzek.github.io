**saving your time**: *Recently, I had the opportunity to serve as an interviewer in a series of interviews for hiring mid-level and senior Site Reliability Engineers (SREs). I decided to share this experience and provide some valuable tips for those preparing for a technical interview*

I want to start by explaining my thought process when evaluating candidates. I was looking for someone with a solid understanding of fundamentals, strong communication skills, and a sense of authenticity in their responses (something I would assess throughout the process). For the **mid-level** position, I aimed to find someone with a solid grasp of the fundamentals, experience in value-driven project delivery, a strong problem-solving mindset, and at least some familiarity with the tech stack, although this last point was not a strict requirement. For the **senior** position, I expected candidates to perform well in technical case studies and complex problem-solving, with expertise in both reliability engineering and software engineering. I don’t subscribe to the idea that an SRE’s role is limited to automation. Instead, I align with the original concept of an SRE as a software engineer whose efforts are directed toward operations. So I started my journey looking for people to fill these positions..

The first step was always checking out the curriculum, which had already been filtered by HR. I wanted to get a feel for the candidate’s experience, the technologies they worked with, and how long they spent at each company. My questions were always based on what I found in the curriculum, and the technical cases usually combined tools or real-world scenarios the person had worked with before. I also like to start with an easy question, something I know they’ll nail, before slowly turning up the heat.
