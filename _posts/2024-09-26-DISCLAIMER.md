## DISCLAIMER

- I write for myself
- My first language is Brazilian Portuguese, but I'm learning English and will use it here. You will likely see some writing mistakes; it's part of learning
- I have worked as a Reliability Engineer only in Brazil (*until now*)
- I plan to discuss reliability topics and other subjects like security, processes, governance, and soft skills
- Feedback is always welcome as long as it‚Äôs constructive. Feel free to contact me on Telegram or Discord, but please be respectful (*@apolzek*)
- Remember, everything here is open to discussion. You should form your **own opinions**

## GOALS

- Talk about tools that are not well-known but have great potential 
- Track my studies with short reflective articles
- Share my views on technologies, processes, and products
- Soon, I will revisit my notes to see how my views on certain topics have changed

## REMEMBER

üáßüá∑ "A √∫nica maneira de fazer as coisas funcionarem bem √© entendendo o motivo pelo qual elas quebram."

üá∫üá∏ "The only way to make things work well is by understanding why they break."
