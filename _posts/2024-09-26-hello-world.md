**saving your time**: *just a brief introduction and my intentions*

## ABOUT

- This blog is a personal project where I share my reflections on reliability engineering, professional growth, and related topics;
- English is **not** my native language, and I’m using this blog to practice and improve my skills. Please bear with me if you find any grammatical or stylistic errors;
- I am a reliability engineer with experience working in Brazil. The views expressed here are my own and do not represent the opinions of my employer or any other organization;
- I write primarily for myself.

## GOALS

- Talk about tools that are not well-known but have great potential(*maybe this will turn into a new project*);
- Track my studies with short reflective articles;
- Share my views on technologies, processes, and products;
- Soon, I will revisit my notes to see how my views on certain topics have changed;
- Share the results of some POCs and labs with friends/colleagues.

## REMARKS

- When the 💬 emoji appears, I want to introduce a point for reflection or an idea exchange;
- When you see the 🗣️ emoji, it means I’m aware I’m saying something completely absurd;
- There is 🕵️ hidden content within this blog; you can find it by exploring or inspecting the source code;
- Fixing is better than criticizing, but any interaction is valuable.

**Welcome aboard !!**

## OTHER PROJECTS

- **@ENV666** is a channel where I will share the results of some proof of concepts (POCs) focused on reliability engineering. The idea is to take down environments and make things break 🔗 [https://www.youtube.com/@ENV666](https://www.youtube.com/@ENV666)
- **@achadosdogithub** is a channel where I aim to give visibility to projects that are highly useful, whether for learning code or discovering cool tools 🔗 [https://www.youtube.com/@achadosdogithub](https://www.youtube.com/@achadosdogithub) -->
