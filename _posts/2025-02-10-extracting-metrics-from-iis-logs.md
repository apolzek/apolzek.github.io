**saving your time**: *Through the log file I want RED metrics from my IIS*

If you're from the new generation and have never worked with IIS, let me introduce you to this **legendary web server**. It’s a secure, easy-to-manage, modular, and extensible platform for hosting websites, services, and applications (by Microsoft). That said… IIS isn’t exactly the hottest thing around these days and there are reasons for that 💥. But, as the old saying goes: **you don’t have to like it, but you should at least learn to live with it**!! 😆

My journey began when I was tasked with understanding the behavior of an IIS server, making it observable, and setting up alarms for potential issues. The first step was to install [windows_exporter](https://github.com/prometheus-community/windows_exporter), which includes the [IIS collector](https://github.com/prometheus-community/windows_exporter/blob/master/docs/collector.iis.md). While it provided many valuable metrics about IIS, it wasn’t exactly what I needed. What I was really looking for were **RED metrics**, more focused on HTTP responses from IIS. I researched some repositories but couldn’t find anything satisfactory. 

Below is the conventional solution I was already using 👇

I spent some time exploring IIS and realized that the only data source that truly met my needs was the **logs**. Although it wasn’t the most elegant solution, using them as a data source solved my problem and, of course, created other challenges.  

The log files contained the **request path, the method used, the status code, and the response time**. These were exactly the pieces of information I needed. Using this data, I identified key metrics.

First, I developed a Python script that parsed log files and transformed them into metrics exposed in HTTP server format, following the traditional model. When I tried to adapt the solution for Windows, I didn't necessarily want to have Python installed on the machine, and when using PyInstaller, I faced many frustrations.

I then decided to rewrite the code in Golang(❤️GOOS=windows GOARCH=amd64 go build -o ..), following the same logic. Upon completion, I decided to deliver the solution in two ways: one approach using Golang exposing as a server, but I would also make use of the textfile collector from Windows Exporter. In this solution, I basically extend the metrics I'm already capturing and can append metrics in Prometheus format to a text file. And who would generate this file ?? The Golang solution? No, I decided to create a native Windows solution using PowerShell. It follows the same logic and executes via Task Scheduler, keeping the file always updated. The metrics appear in the Windows Exporter that I was already using, and everything else continues as it was.

**Solution 1**

```
Prometheus--> iis_log_exporter.exe --> C:\inetpub\logs\LogFiles\W3SVC2
```

**Solution 2**

```
Prometheus--> windows_exporter--> metrics.prom <-- iis_log_exporter.ps1 (task scheduler)
```

I would like to comment on some implementation details. First, I didn't want to read the entire file every time, so I created a control mechanism using a file offset. This way I know which line I stopped at and from which file. This approach may cause inconsistencies because a human could modify the log file, but it was the best solution I could think of at the moment.

```
{
"Day_2025-03-24":  "2025-03-24",
"C:\\inetpub\\logs\\LogFiles\\W3SVC3\\u_ex250324.log_lastWrite":  "2025-03-24T13:59:58.0254582-07:00",
"C:\\inetpub\\logs\\LogFiles\\W3SVC3\\u_ex250323.log_lastWrite":  "2025-03-23T09:55:35.0645693-07:00"
}
```

Another thing was that I implemented the logic to monitor by **Site** folder. This means that in the PowerShell solution, if I have 3 sites, I would create 3 tasks to monitor and generate metrics from the day's file. That's another detail: the system always analyzes the current day's file based on the server date.

**TIP**: If you want to continue using the windows_exporter, simply enable the textfile collector and specify the location where the metrics file will be, based on the PowerShell configuration below. If you want a new exporter, you can use the Golang version with a binary compiled for Windows. Using the windows_exporter metrics with the iis_log_exporter can provide a better understanding of IIS behavior and its transactions.
