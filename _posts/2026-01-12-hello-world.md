**saving you some time**: *just a quick intro and what I’m trying to do here*

## ABOUT

- This blog is a personal side project where I dump thoughts about reliability engineering, observability, programming, and adjacent rabbit holes;
- English isn’t my first language. I’m writing in English on purpose to practice and get better, so yeah, there may be rough edges;
- I’m a reliability engineer/platform engineer with professional experience in Brazil. Everything written here reflects my own opinions, not my employer’s or anyone else’s;
- Mostly, I write for myself.

## GOALS

- Talk about tools that fly under the radar but are genuinely interesting;
- Keep track of my studies through short, reflective posts;
- Share opinions and experiences around open-source projects;
- Revisit old notes in the future and see how my thinking has evolved;
- Share the results of POCs and labs with friends and colleagues.

**Welcome aboard!!**
