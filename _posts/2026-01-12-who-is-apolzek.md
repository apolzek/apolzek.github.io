About the profile image: **Júlio**

**Júlio**, from *Cocoricó*, is the pure embodiment of a curious boy. He lives on a farm, but his mind is always wandering: he asks questions, imagines possibilities, tests slightly crazy hypotheses, and learns along the way. His curiosity isn’t just about knowing “what something is,” but “why it is that way” and “what if it were different.” This often puts him in confusing situations, but it is also the driving force behind all his discoveries.
