About the profile image: **Júlio**

**Júlio**, from *Cocoricó*, is the pure embodiment of a curious boy. He lives on a farm, but his mind is always wandering: he asks questions, imagines possibilities, tests slightly crazy hypotheses, and learns along the way. His curiosity isn’t just about knowing “what something is,” but “why it is that way” and “what if it were different.” This often puts him in confusing situations, but it is also the driving force behind all his discoveries.

Like Júlio, I am trying to return to the purity of my being and relearn how to learn. This blog is a mixture of technical topics, philosophical reflections, personal confessions, and worldviews. Here, I write primarily for myself, with the intention of being honest rather than performing for the world. If you are reading this, know that I am no longer the same person who wrote these words. May we walk with the presence of God.

<!--Daughter, today you were extubated at Vila da Serra Hospital. I am so happy that it creates indescribable reactions in me. I love you, I love our family, I love life, I love God.-->

<!--In a contradictory way, apolzek is my true self. Vinicius Gomes Batista carries many social masks, absorbed over time, but they do not represent my essence or who I truly am. This becomes evident in many everyday situations. The way I chose to confront this was by creating an identity called apolzek. In everything I do through this identity, I strive to be honest with myself, refusing to let the world shape or direct me. In those moments, it is only me and God.-->
