   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Júlio&lt;/strong&gt;, from &lt;em&gt;Cocoricó&lt;/em&gt;, is the pure embodiment of a curious boy. He lives on a farm, but his mind is always wandering: he asks questions, imagines possibilities, tests slightly crazy hypotheses, and learns along the way. His curiosity isn’t just about knowing “what something is,” but “why it is that way” and “what if it were different.” This often puts him in confusing situations, but it is also the driving force behind all his discoveries.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Like Júlio, I am trying to return to the purity of my being and relearn how to learn. This blog is a mixture of technical topics, philosophical reflections, personal confessions, and worldviews. Here, I write primarily for myself, with the intention of being honest rather than performing for the world.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some people use a nickname to hide behind a character. To me, our given name is already a projection of the person we pretend to be. We naturally create a social mask to navigate the world and interact with others. That’s why &lt;strong&gt;apolzek&lt;/strong&gt; is where I place my essence and express my true identity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you’ve stumbled upon this, welcome aboard! When you read any post here, know that you’ll be behind the scenes of my mind. Let’s go together, let’s go with &lt;strong&gt;God&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!--
Daughter, 2025 Jan 15 you were extubated at Vila da Serra Hospital. I am so happy that it creates indescribable reactions in me. I love you, I love our family, I love life, I love God.
--&gt;

&lt;!-- 
My birth name, Vinícius Gomes Batista, is the name I was given when I was presented to God and welcomed into this life. It holds my story, my family roots, and a sense of purpose. Over the years, though, that name has picked up so many layers. Social expectations, roles I learned to play, ways I adapted to fit in. Most of the time those things don’t feel like the real me at my deepest level. That’s why I created apolzek. It’s not about replacing Vinícius or turning my back on him. It’s more like a deliberate practice, almost a quiet sacred space, where I try to bring the real Vinícius closer to who he truly is underneath everything. When I’m in apolzek mode, I focus on stripping away those extra layers. I try to speak and act with complete honesty toward myself, and I refuse to let the outside world tell me who I’m supposed to be. In those moments it’s just me, no masks, standing in front of God.
