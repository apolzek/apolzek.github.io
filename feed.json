            "content_text": "saving your time: Prometheus exporters are applications that extract data from services or processes and expose it in Prometheus format. This article provides a brief analysis of blackbox_exporter and network_exporter, highlighting their use cases and the key differences between themIntroductionThis type of article can be somewhat controversial because there are multiple approaches to working with these exporters. My goal is to share my perspective on where each should be used and the results you can expect.First, it’s important to clarify that we’re dealing with network exporters. While they greatly enhance observability, I believe there are more professional ways to analyze a network. That said, the insights provided by both can help reliability engineers and software engineers quickly and easily understand their environments.So, which one should you use? My answer is simple and direct: both !!blackbox_exporterThe blackbox exporter allows blackbox probing of endpoints over HTTP, HTTPS, DNS, TCP, ICMP and gRPC.As the name suggests, blackbox_exporter is designed to simulate an external user calling an endpoint within your environment. It mimics a simple user request, monitoring the availability and performance of external endpoints such as websites, APIs, or network services. Two key pieces of information it provides are SSL certificate verification and latency measurement. In short, I consider it an external probe that makes requests to something inside your environment. You can use blackbox_exporter inside or outside your main environment, the idea is that it is positioned at the source location to perform checks on a destination, analyzing a real flow.multi-target exporterThe Blackbox Exporter follows the multi-target exporter pattern, allowing Prometheus to probe multiple targets without requiring an agent on each one. It works by receiving targets and a query configuration as parameters, performing network probes (such as HTTP, ICMP, or DNS), and exposing the results as metrics. This approach is particularly useful for monitoring external services, network devices, and internet-facing endpoints.To configure it, the Blackbox Exporter is deployed and set up with specific probe modules in blackbox.yml. Prometheus is then configured to send requests to it via the /probe endpoint, specifying targets dynamically. The exporter executes the probes and returns the results as Prometheus metrics, which can be used for alerting and visualization.Ex: http://localhost:9115/probe?target=github.com&amp;module=http_2xx&amp;debug=true[Prometheus] → [Blackbox Exporter] → [Target]      ↑              |      |              ↓   Metrics       Probing (HTTP, ICMP, etc.)  (Targets)The blackbox configuration is where you put which monitoring modules you want to use, such as HTTP. The configuration of the targets themselves is in prometheus. Ex:modules:  http_2xx:    prober: http    http:      preferred_ip_protocol: \"ip4\"  http_post_2xx:    prober: http    http:      method: POST  tcp_connect:    prober: tcp  grpc:    prober: grpc    grpc:      tls: true      preferred_ip_protocol: \"ip4\"  ssh_banner:    prober: tcp    tcp:      query_response:      - expect: \"^SSH-2.0-\"      - send: \"SSH-2.0-blackbox-ssh-check\"  ssh_banner_extract:    prober: tcp    timeout: 5s    tcp:      query_response:      - expect: \"^SSH-2.0-([^ -]+)(?: (.*))?$\"        labels:        - name: ssh_version          value: \"${1}\"        - name: ssh_comments          value: \"${2}\"  icmp:    prober: icmp  icmp_ttl5:    prober: icmp    timeout: 5s    icmp:      ttl: 5network_exporternetwork_exporter can also be used in more than one way, but I usually use it for an inside-out analysis. In other words, I use it to track all external dependencies of my application or any workload I’m running, be it an external API, a database, an endpoint accessed via VPN or proxy, and so on. It’s particularly useful when an external dependency goes down or when there’s a network issue along the way, like a lost ACL or hardware failure. While it doesn’t support SSL checks, some of the metrics from blackbox_exporter also exist in network_exporter 😊Exported metrics:ping_up Exporter stateping_targets Number of active targetsping_status: Ping Statusping_rtt_seconds{type=best}: Best round trip time in secondsping_rtt_seconds{type=worst}: Worst round trip time in secondsping_rtt_seconds{type=mean}: Mean round trip time in secondsping_rtt_seconds{type=sum}: Sum round trip time in secondsping_rtt_seconds{type=sd}: Squared deviation in secondsping_rtt_seconds{type=usd}: Standard deviation without correction in secondsping_rtt_seconds{type=csd}: Standard deviation with correction (Bessel's) in secondsping_rtt_seconds{type=range}: Range in secondsping_rtt_snt_count: Packet sent count totalping_rtt_snt_fail_count: Packet sent fail count totalping_rtt_snt_seconds: Packet sent time total in secondsping_loss_percent: Packet loss in percentmtr_up Exporter statemtr_targets Number of active targetsmtr_hops Number of route hopsmtr_rtt_seconds{type=last}: Last round trip time in secondsmtr_rtt_seconds{type=best}: Best round trip time in secondsmtr_rtt_seconds{type=worst}: Worst round trip time in secondsmtr_rtt_seconds{type=mean}: Mean round trip time in secondsmtr_rtt_seconds{type=sum}: Sum round trip time in secondsmtr_rtt_seconds{type=sd}: Squared deviation in secondsmtr_rtt_seconds{type=usd}: Standard deviation without correction in secondsmtr_rtt_seconds{type=csd}: Standard deviation with correction (Bessel's) in secondsmtr_rtt_seconds{type=range}: Range in secondsmtr_rtt_seconds{type=loss}: Packet loss in percentmtr_rtt_snt_count: Packet sent count totalmtr_rtt_snt_fail_count: Packet sent fail count totalmtr_rtt_snt_seconds: Packet sent time total in secondstcp_up Exporter statetcp_targets Number of active targetstcp_connection_status Connection Statustcp_connection_seconds Connection time in secondshttp_get_up Exporter statehttp_get_targets Number of active targetshttp_get_status HTTP Status Code and Connection Statushttp_get_content_bytes HTTP Get Content Size in byteshttp_get_seconds{type=DNSLookup}: DNSLookup connection drill down time in secondshttp_get_seconds{type=TCPConnection}: TCPConnection connection drill down time in secondshttp_get_seconds{type=TLSHandshake}: TLSHandshake connection drill down time in secondshttp_get_seconds{type=TLSEarliestCertExpiry}: TLSEarliestCertExpiry cert expiration time in epochhttp_get_seconds{type=TLSLastChainExpiry}: TLSLastChainExpiry cert expiration time in epochhttp_get_seconds{type=ServerProcessing}: ServerProcessing connection drill down time in secondshttp_get_seconds{type=ContentTransfer}: ContentTransfer connection drill down time in secondshttp_get_seconds{type=Total}: Total connection time in secondsPoCThis PoC showcases monitoring in a Kubernetes environment using network_exporter to analyze connectivity from inside out and blackbox_exporter to simulate external access and assess service availability from outside in.The dependencies of my application, which is behind a service, are a database and an external API.

            "content_text": "saving your time: How I built an IIS prometheus exporter for a RED metrics dashboardIf you’re from the new generation and have never worked with IIS, let me introduce you to this legendary web server. It’s a secure, easy-to-manage, modular, and extensible platform for hosting websites, services, and applications (by Microsoft). That said… IIS isn’t exactly the hottest thing around these days and there are reasons for that 💥. But, as the old saying goes: you don’t have to like it, but you should at least learn to live with it!! 😆My journey began when I was tasked with understanding the behavior of an IIS server, making it observable, and setting up alarms for potential issues. The first step was to install windows_exporter, which includes the IIS collector. While it provided many valuable metrics about IIS, it wasn’t exactly what I needed. What I was really looking for were RED metrics, more focused on HTTP responses from IIS. I researched some repositories but couldn’t find anything satisfactory. So, I decided to build my own exporter to gather these metrics.I spent some time exploring IIS and realized that the only data source that truly met my needs was the logs. Although it wasn’t the most elegant solution, using them as a data source solved my problem and, of course, created other challenges. With that in mind, I developed a Python exporter that reads IIS log files from the corresponding folder, always pointing to and processing the logs of the day. The result is still in validation, but I’d like to share what I have so far. Take a look belowrepository: https://github.com/apolzek/iis_log_exporterThe log files contained the request path, the method used, the status code, and the response time. These were exactly the pieces of information I needed. Using this data, I identified key metrics.iis_requests_duration_seconds = Histogram(    \"iis_requests_duration_seconds\", \"Duration of HTTP requests in IIS\",    [\"method\", \"path\"])iis_exceptions_total = Counter(    \"iis_exceptions_total\", \"Total number of HTTP requests with 5xx status codes\",    [\"method\", \"path\", \"status_code\"])iis_requests_total = Counter(    \"iis_requests_total\", \"Total number of HTTP requests from IIS\",    [\"method\", \"path\", \"status_code\"])💬 From the beginning, my goal was never to replace the IIS module of windows_exporter, but rather to complement it with more detailed HTTP metrics for hosted applications. With this in mind, the final outcome I aim for is a dashboard that integrates the metrics from windows_exporter with those from iis_log_exporter. The main challenges I faced while building this exporter were, first, that I couldn’t keep re-reading the log file, as it could grow indefinitely and cause metric inconsistencies. Second, I always needed to read only the log files for the current day. To solve the first issue, I implemented an offset system where I store the last scraped line in a file. For the second, I used the file’s creation date from the OS while relying on its filename within the folder.I know these approaches have potential failure points someone could manually add logs to the file, IIS configurations might generate logs missing key data that break the regex logic, and so on. That said, I recognize that this solution is still very tailored to my specific use case, but I hope it can evolve to support other legacy IIS systems out there.Below is the conventional solution I was already using 👇 collector.iisTIP: Integrating the windows_exporter, which already includes the IIS modules, with this exporter (named iis_log_exporter) can yield excellent results.. Good luck to us !!Pull requests are welcome in the exporter’s repository !! 🫶🏻 bye-bye",

Using this data, I identified key metrics.</p><div class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\"><div class=\"highlight\"><pre class=\"highlight\"><code>iis_requests_duration_seconds = Histogram(    \"iis_requests_duration_seconds\", \"Duration of HTTP requests in IIS\",    [\"method\", \"path\"])iis_exceptions_total = Counter(    \"iis_exceptions_total\", \"Total number of HTTP requests with 5xx status codes\",    [\"method\", \"path\", \"status_code\"])iis_requests_total = Counter(    \"iis_requests_total\", \"Total number of HTTP requests from IIS\",    [\"method\", \"path\", \"status_code\"])</code></pre></div></div><p>💬 From the beginning, my goal was never to <strong>replace</strong> the IIS module of <strong>windows_exporter</strong>, but rather to complement it with more detailed HTTP metrics for hosted applications. With this in mind, the final outcome I aim for is a dashboard that integrates the metrics from windows_exporter with those from iis_log_exporter. The main challenges I faced while building this exporter were, first, that I couldn’t keep re-reading the log file, as it could grow indefinitely and cause metric inconsistencies. Second, I always needed to read only the log files for the current day. To solve the first issue, I implemented an <strong>offset</strong> system where I store the last scraped line in a file. For the second, I used the file’s creation date from the OS while relying on its filename within the folder.</p><p>I know these approaches have potential failure points someone could manually add logs to the file, IIS configurations might generate logs missing key data that break the regex logic, and so on. That said, I recognize that this solution is still very tailored to my specific use case, but I hope it can evolve to support other legacy IIS systems out there.</p><p>Below is the conventional solution I was already using 👇</p><p><img src=\"/assets/img/iis_collector.png\" alt=\"iis_collector\" /> <a href=\"https://github.com/prometheus-community/windows_exporter/blob/master/docs/collector.iis.md\">collector.iis</a></p><p><strong>TIP</strong>: Integrating the windows_exporter, which already includes the IIS modules, with this exporter (named iis_log_exporter) can yield excellent results.. Good luck to us !!</p><p><img src=\"/assets/gif/together.webp\" alt=\"together\" /></p><p>Pull requests are welcome in the exporter’s repository !! 🫶🏻 bye-bye</p><!-- https://www.sysgauge.com/ -->",

If you work in DevOps or reliability engineering, you’re likely already familiar with tools like Containerd, Kubernetes, Helm, Terraform, Crossplane, Jenkins, ArgoCD, Ansible, KEDA, Jaeger, Istio, OpenTelemetry, and many others. Even with excellent organizations like CNCF providing structure, upgrading some of these tools in critical environments can become quite complex. This is especially true for those directly tied to workloads with a significant impact on products, such as Containerd, Kubernetes, and Istio. Other updates can also be risky, and their side effects may be even harder to identify. In short, I believe these solutions come with their own challenges. That doesn’t mean you shouldn’t use them, but it’s crucial to keep in mind that adopting any of these tools means you’ll have to deal with updates. And when those updates involve security, they often need to be done with urgency.Security vs. ProductivityThe topic of security has significantly complicated my daily work routine, while also generating a growing backlog for reliability and software engineering teams. Everyone knows that security must be embedded in every level of an organization, as well as within individuals. It plays a vital role in the business and goes beyond the technological sphere. Having worked with banks and fintechs, I understand that security is even more critical in these environments, where organizations face numerous regulatory requirements and compliance obligations. I see this topic as a significant challenge because it directly affects employees’ lives, who often feel unproductive or pressured by the bureaucracy applied to technology and processes. A simple analogy: imagine you’re teaching your child to ride a bike but want to ensure they don’t get hurt if they fall. You equip them with every possible safety device so that even if they fall, they won’t be injured. However, the excess of equipment makes it impossible for them to ride the bike. This isn’t about debating whether we need security, that’s already clear. Instead, we should reflect on how we want to approach security and strike the right balance to ensure both safety and efficiency.💬 II believe this topic may have some relation to employee burnoutsBuilding economicallyIt is very common to see companies being overwhelmed by costs in cloud providers like AWS, Azure, and GCP, as well as by extremely expensive bills from observability vendors like Dynatrace, New Relic, and Datadog. The key point here is that we usually build first and only think about cost optimization later, instead of bringing this discussion to the beginning of projects. Once everything is built and running well, with the SLO achieved, reducing costs becomes much more complex. I see it as a major challenge to shift our mindset toward understanding and calculating costs based on technical decisions from the start of any project. I notice that few people truly appreciate efficiency those who deliver faster usually get more recognition. We should aim for sustainable solutions, considering cost progression over time and avoiding vendor lock-in.Fragile points in complex systems/architecturesThe use of complex architectures with microservices, non-relational databases, and messaging services is common in organizations that need to scale to serve a large number of users. While complexity is relative, dealing with systems composed of various subsystems and different levels of abstraction often makes decision-making challenging, especially during critical situations. I have witnessed scenarios where the feature toggle system of an application failed, directly impacting the application’s functionality. I have also seen cases where a cache system failure brought an entire product down. These fragilities have cost me many sleepless nights. For 2025, the challenge I propose is to develop solutions that can scale without being overly sensitive to dependencies, operate with alternative paths, and recover from potential failures autonomously and efficiently.Solution = Shift left Costs + Security + ObservabilityHonestly, I think these are the main challenges for 2025 in my line of work. So, what’s the plan ?? We tackle them head-on. The idea is to deliver value, get stuff done, and have some fun along the way, working with Delphi or whipping up a new CI/CD pipeline.

By abstracting infrastructure and networking, it enables fast, cost-effective container deployment. Users can make applications publicly accessible or control access as needed. Unlike traditional solutions focused on large enterprises with strict SLAs, nanopods prioritizes simplicity and accessibility, creating an agile environment for rapid testing and iteration, without the complexity of managing traditional servers.I’m still thinking about the legal issues..About the ideaThe idea is basically a render.com with some differences. I want to do something more “api first”.

I want to create a business abstraction on top of Kubernetes and put all the complexity into it using tools I have experience with. I need a cheap domain like nanopods.io. I need a payment method and reasonable bandwidth. I want to physically separate the servers where applications are from the servers where the end-user containers will be.

In a KRaft-based installation, Kafka brokers manage metadata and leader election directly, which simplifies the architecture by reducing dependencies. KRaft is becoming the default option in newer Kafka versions because it provides better scalability, faster failover, and an overall more streamlined operation.Kafka with ZooKeeper: In traditional Kafka deployments, ZooKeeper is used to manage the cluster’s metadata, such as broker details and topic configurations. ZooKeeper handles tasks like leader election and tracking which brokers are active. While this setup has been robust for years, it adds complexity by requiring an additional service (ZooKeeper) that must be installed, managed, and maintained alongside Kafka.Install RabbitMQ1 Create a YAML file /tmp/rabbitmq.yml with the content belowapiVersion: v1kind: Namespacemetadata:  name: rabbitmqspec: {}status: {}---apiVersion: v1kind: ServiceAccountmetadata:  name: rabbitmq  namespace: rabbitmq---kind: RoleapiVersion: rbac.authorization.k8s.io/v1metadata:  name: rabbitmq  namespace: rabbitmqrules:- apiGroups:    - \"\"  resources:    - endpoints  verbs:    - get    - list    - watch---kind: RoleBindingapiVersion: rbac.authorization.k8s.io/v1metadata:  name: rabbitmq  namespace: rabbitmqsubjects:- kind: ServiceAccount  name: rabbitmqroleRef:  apiGroup: rbac.authorization.k8s.io  kind: Role   name: rabbitmq---apiVersion: v1kind: Secretmetadata:  name: rabbit-secret  namespace: rabbitmqtype: Opaquedata:  RABBITMQ_ERLANG_COOKIE: V0lXVkhDRFRDSVVBV0FOTE1RQVc=  RABBITMQ_DEFAULT_USER: Y29lbGhv  RABBITMQ_DEFAULT_PASS: Y29lbGhvQFBhc3M=---apiVersion: v1kind: ConfigMapmetadata:  name: rabbitmq-config  namespace: rabbitmqdata:  enabled_plugins: |    [rabbitmq_management,rabbitmq_peer_discovery_k8s].  rabbitmq.conf: |    ## Cluster formation.

ZooKeeper</h3><p><strong>Kafka KRaft Installation</strong>: KRaft is Kafka’s new built-in consensus mechanism that eliminates the need for ZooKeeper. In a KRaft-based installation, Kafka brokers manage metadata and leader election directly, which simplifies the architecture by reducing dependencies. KRaft is becoming the default option in newer Kafka versions because it provides better scalability, faster failover, and an overall more streamlined operation.</p><p><strong>Kafka with ZooKeeper</strong>: In traditional Kafka deployments, ZooKeeper is used to manage the cluster’s metadata, such as broker details and topic configurations. ZooKeeper handles tasks like leader election and tracking which brokers are active. While this setup has been robust for years, it adds complexity by requiring an additional service (ZooKeeper) that must be installed, managed, and maintained alongside Kafka.</p><h2
