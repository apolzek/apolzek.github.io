I am so happy that it creates indescribable reactions in me. I love you, I love our family, I love life, I love God.--><!-- My birth name, Vinícius Gomes Batista, is the name I was given when I was presented to God and welcomed into this life. It holds my story, my family roots, and a sense of purpose. Over the years, though, that name has picked up so many layers. Social expectations, roles I learned to play, ways I adapted to fit in. Most of the time those things don’t feel like the real me at my deepest level. That’s why I created apolzek. It’s not about replacing Vinícius or turning my back on him. It’s more like a deliberate practice, almost a quiet sacred space, where I try to bring the real Vinícius closer to who he truly is underneath everything. When I’m in apolzek mode, I focus on stripping away those extra layers. I try to speak and act with complete honesty toward myself, and I refuse to let the outside world tell me who I’m supposed to be. In those moments it’s just me, no masks, standing in front of God.-->",
